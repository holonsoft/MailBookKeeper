Addon links sent mail info into chat frame (with item summary, subject, etc..) and keeps history which you can show by 

/mailbookkeeper  history
/mailbookkeeper  show

command

With 

/mailbookkeeper  delete

you can cleanup your history

To shorten command you can use

/mbk <cmd>


It tracks all incoming and outgoing mails for an account. You can see what every of your characters got (gold, items) or has sent to someone else (or another char of yours).
It's a fork of "Mail Outbox" addon which is not updated anymore since several years. So I decided to fork it, repair LUA problems and get a base for further development of this addon.

At the moment World of Warcraft Version 10.0 is supported. Because I do'nt like to play classic, it is not tested at all for it.


Extra notes:
A small project to get familar with LUA (with a smell of WoW)

Original addon was "Mail Outbox" from DieenDieen (licensed as PUBLIC DOMAIN), but after 6 years of no-development it was time to create something new on top. And remove LUA errors and so on.

Have fun with this addon


Further plans:

Search and/or filter 
- date
- sender
- receipient
- content

Summary line

Date/Time count of mails

Count of unique senders

Count of unique receipients 

Summary gold sent
Summary gold received
Summary costs

assign char to bnet tag


Roadmap for classic:
Add a timer for 60 min mail waiting

Attention: There's no concrete timetable for realizing this feature
